# GitHub Actions

We use pinned actions automatically updated by `dependabot` for security (check [zizmor's audit rules](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/) to learn more about the security issue with GitHub actions).

You can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test your GitHub actions locally.

## Default Workflows

The template comes with complete workflows for CI and CD.

## TODOs

- ✅ Check that `uv` cache works
- ✅ Check that `md test reports` are generated
- Check that coverage is uploaded
- Create `release` workflow
- Check if more actions should be added
